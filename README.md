# ai_project_chatbot
An AI-based advanced chatbot built using Python and Machine Learning. It uses Logistic Regression and TF-IDF to understand user messages and respond smartly. Includes a Tkinter GUI with image category buttons to display Animals, Flowers, Scenery, Sci-Fi, and Cute images. Simple, interactive and user-friendly design.
