# ai_project_chatbot
An AI-based advanced chatbot built using Python and Machine Learning. It uses Logistic Regression and TF-IDF to understand user messages and respond smartly. Includes a Tkinter GUI with image category buttons to display Animals, Flowers, Scenery, Sci-Fi, and Cute images. Simple, interactive and user-friendly design.
AI-Based Advanced Chatbot using Python & Machine Learning

This project is an interactive AI chatbot developed using Python, Tkinter GUI, and Machine Learning.
It understands user input using Logistic Regression + TF-IDF and responds intelligently with text.
The chatbot also displays image categories like Animals, Flowers, Scenery, Sci-Fi and Cute through browser automation.
